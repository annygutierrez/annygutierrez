                   <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Roboto', fontSize: '14px' }}>In my still short time alive, I handled several and very different positions, such as housekeeper, luthier, waitress, cart attendant, front-end developer, back-end developer, designer (every now and then). These jobs made me, and helped me realize that I should stick with my interests instead of let the world fade them away, specially when they are friking enjoyable.</p>
                   <p style={{ fontFamily: 'Roboto', fontSize: '14px' }}> ðŸ˜€  My biggest hope as someone who loves technology and art is to become a maker, someone who can make some wild ideas reality.</p>
